# next-multilingual

An opinionated end-to-end **multilingual** solution for Next.js.

## Installation

```
npm install next-multilingual
```

## What's in it for me?

- The enforcement of i18n best practices across your entire application.
- All URLs will use a locale prefix - this is currently a limitation of Next.js where the default locale does not use a prefix.
- Smart language detection that dynamically renders the homepage, without using redirections.
- The ability to use localized URLs (e.g. `/en-us/contact-us` for U.S. English and `/fr-ca/nous-joindre` for Canadian French).
- Automatically generate canonical and alternate links optimized for SEO.
- Modular localized string configuration support that works just like CSS (no more files containing shared strings).

## Usage

For those who prefer to jump right into the action, look in the `example` directory for an end-to-end implementation of `next-multilingual`. For the rest, the section below will provide a complete configuration guide in 3 simple steps.

### ✔️ Step 1️: Configure Next.js

There are many options to configure in Next.js to achieve our goals. We offer two APIs to simplify this step:


#### 〰️ `getMulConfig` (simple config)

Short for "get multilingual configuration", this function will generate a Next.js config that will meet most use cases. Simply add the following code in your application's `next.config.js`:

```js
const { getMulConfig } = require('next-multilingual/config');
module.exports = getMulConfig(['en-US', 'fr-CA'], { poweredByHeader: false });
```

#### 〰️ `MulConfig` (advanced config)

If you have more advanced needs, you can use the `MulConfig` object directly and insert the configuration required by `next-multilingual` directly in an existing `next.config.js`:

```js
const { MulConfig } = require('next-multilingual/config');

const mulConfig = new MulConfig(['en-US', 'fr-CA']);

module.exports = {
    i18n: {
        locales: mulConfig.getUrlLocalePrefixes(),
        defaultLocale: mulConfig.getDefaultUrlLocalePrefix(),
        localeDetection: false
    },
    poweredByHeader: false,
    webpack(config, { isServer }) {
        if (isServer) {
            config.resolve.alias['next-multilingual/link$'] = require.resolve('next-multilingual/link-ssr');
        }

        config.module.rules.push({
            test: /\.properties$/,
            loader: 'properties-json-loader',
            options: {
                namespaces: false
            }
        });
        return config;
    },
    async rewrites() {
        return mulConfig.getRewrites();
    },
    async redirects() {
        return mulConfig.getRedirects();
    }
};

```

For more details on the `next-multilingual/config` API, check its [README](./src/config/README.md) file.

### ✔️ Step 2: Create Pages

Add pages in your `pages` directory and for each page, add a `<Page-Name>.<locale>.properties` for all locales - localized routes will use the `title` key of the file to use in the localized URLs.

### ✔️ Step 3: Add SEO friendly HTML markup for your URLs

As per [Google](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/advanced/crawling/localized-versions), alternate links must be fully-qualified, including the transport method (http/https). Because Next.js does not know which URL is used at build time, we need to configure them for each environment:

Create an `.env.development` file with the following variable (adjust based on your setup):

```ini
NEXT_PUBLIC_ORIGIN="http://localhost:3000"
```

Regardless of the environment, `next-multilingual` will look for a variables called `NEXT_PUBLIC_ORIGIN` to generate fully-qualified URLs. If you are using Next.js' [`basePath`](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-reference/next.config.js/basepath), it will be added automatically to the base URL.

#### 〰️ `MulHead`

Now all that you need to do is add the `MulHead` component to your pages. We recommend to use it on all pages, and if you are
using a [`Layout`](./example/layout/Layout.tsx) component like in the example, the following code will do the trick:

```html
<MulHead>
    <title>{title}</title>
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
</MulHead>
```

## Why `next-multilingual`?

Why did we put so much efforts with these details? Because our hypothesis is that it can have a major impact on:

- SEO;
- boosting customer trust with more locally relevant content;
- making string management easier and more modular.

More details an be found on the implementation and design decision in the individual README files of each API and in the [documentation](./doc) directory.
